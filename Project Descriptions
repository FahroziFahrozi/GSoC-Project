#Google Summer of Code projects under R Statistical COmputing

I plan to produce a package like the Eechidna package, but for Indonesia. It will include the raw
data, and several vignettes with visualisations that explore the data to answer common questions
about voting patterns.
In Eechidna package makes it easy to look at the data from several years worth of Australian
Censuses and Federal Elections. Functions in the package can be used to pull the most recent
election and Census data, and future changes. In this project I will use for Indonesia election
case. I will use the election data 2014 about Legilative election and Presidential Election including census data as well from Indonesian Statistics office
