# Indoelectdata

The purpose of this package is to make available data from the Indonedian General Election of 2014. The package was created by Fahrozi for a Google Summer of Code Project in 2019, with assistence from Jeremy Forbes and Ben Marwick

## Background

An election is one of the main pillars of an accumulation of people's will, General Election as well as a democratic procedure for choosing leaders.

In Indonesia, elections are a matter of great waiting because it is a party of democracy for all people to choose leaders of their choice. Elections also generate data which is of great public interest, but often not easy to access or work with. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics and R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R makes data analysis accessible to everyone and, of course, can help us to answer questions about data. 

Among the many packages available for R, there is a package called eechidna (Exploring Election and Census Highly Informative Data Nationally for Australia). This package makes it easy to look at the data from several years worth of Australian Censuses and Federal Elections. Functions in the package can be used to pull the most recent election and Census data, and future changes. \[1\].

The main goal of my project is to explore the elections and census data from The Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). I will explore and make a visualization of Legislative and presidential elections data on 2014.

# Proposal for Google Summer of Code projects under R Statistical Computing

I plan to produce a package like the [eechidna](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eechidna/index.html) package, but for Indonesia. It will include:

- the raw data, 
- several vignettes with visualisations that explore the data to answer common questions
about voting patterns.

The eechidna package makes it easy to look at the data from several years worth of Australian Censuses and Federal Elections. 

Functions in the package can be used to pull the most recent election and Census data, and future changes. 

In this project I will use Indonesia election data. I will use the election data from the 2014 Legilsative election and Presidential Election, including census data from the Indonesian Statistics office.

Timeline:

 Community bonding period ( May 7 – May 27) :
- [ ]    Discuss with mentors, a plan, to go about implementing more about the project.
- [ ]   The period can also be used to further refine, discuss and plan the components of the   proposal which are not very clear.
- [ ]    Enhance and make familiar about the Eechidna package.
- [ ]  **acquire the data**

Week 1 & Week 2 (May 27 – June 8)
- [ ]     Discuss with mentors related about the Data sets.
- [ ]    Exploring the data election and data census
- [ ]     Analyze the data about election result part of (Party won the Election, Party received the most ordinary votes, Candidate did the best) use Eechidna R package.

 Week 3 & Week 4 (June 9 – June 23)
- [ ]     Internal Evaluate the first and second week result for each part of analysis.
- [ ]     Continue to analyze the data of election result in Candidate won with the smallest number of votes, electorate vote in each state, and party votes correlated.
 
First Evaluation ( June 24- June 28)
 
Week 5 & 6  ( July 1 – July 12)
 
- [ ]     Discuss with mentors the next step implementing project
- [ ]     Analyze of Census data
- [ ]    Analyze and see how election results correlate with census data
 
Week 7  ( July 15 – July 19)
- [ ]     Discuss and internal evaluate with mentors related about the election results correlated with census data.
- [ ]     Make modelling election result using census data.
 
 Second Evaluation ( July 22- July 26)
 
Week 8 & Week 9 (July 29 – August 19)
- [ ]     Discuss with mentors related about work in previous week
- [ ]     Mapping of Indonesia electoral divisions
 
Week 10 & Week 11 ( August 12 – August 25 )
- [ ]     Check and evaluate the result for Mapping of Electoral divisions with mentors
     - [ ]     Improve code quality
- [ ]     Final testing for the whole analysis of data
- [ ]     Documentation the whole result
- [ ]     Prepare and submit the final evaluation
 
Final Evaluation ( August 26- September 2)
