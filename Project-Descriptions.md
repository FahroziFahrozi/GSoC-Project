# Google Summer of Code projects under R Statistical Computing

I plan to produce a package like the [eechidna](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eechidna/index.html) package, but for Indonesia. It will include:

- the raw data, 
- several vignettes with visualisations that explore the data to answer common questions
about voting patterns.

The eechidna package makes it easy to look at the data from several years worth of Australian Censuses and Federal Elections. 

Functions in the package can be used to pull the most recent election and Census data, and future changes. 

In this project I will use Indonesia election data. I will use the election data from the 2014 Legilsative election and Presidential Election, including census data from the Indonesian Statistics office.
